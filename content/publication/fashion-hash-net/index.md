With the rapid growth of fashion-focused social networks and on-line shopping, intelligent fashion recommendation is now in great needs. Recommending fashion outﬁts, each of which is composed of multiple interacted clothing and accessories, is relatively new to the ﬁeld. The problem becomes even more interesting and challenging when considering users’ personalized fashion style. Another challenge in a large-scale fashion outﬁt recommendation system is the efﬁciency issue of item/outﬁt search and storage. In this paper, we propose to learn binary code for efﬁcient personalized fashion outﬁts recommendation. Our system consists of three components, a feature network for content extraction, some type-dependent hashing modules to learn binary codes, and a matching block that conducts pairwise matching. The whole framework is trained in an end-to-end manner. We collect outﬁt data together with user label information from a fashion-focused social website for the personalized recommendation task. Extensive experiments on our datasets show that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods signiﬁcantly even with a simple backbone.
